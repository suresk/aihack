Wonderful staff!
Absolutely loved my time here! The staff were welcoming, and they went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable. The food was top-notch, especially the appetizers. It’s rare to find a place that pays such attention to both quality and service.

Pleasant but not memorable
A decent spot if you're in the area. The food was fresh, though not very memorable, and the staff were polite but seemed a bit overwhelmed. A good option if you're looking for something simple.

Pleasant but not memorable
Nice atmosphere and a good selection on the menu. While it wasn’t mind-blowing, it was a comfortable place to spend an evening. I'd recommend it if you’re nearby.

Decent experience
It was okay but nothing special. The food was decent, but I found the portions a bit small for the price. The atmosphere is nice, though, and the staff were polite. If you're in the area, it’s a good option, but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit again.

Not my taste
The decor was stunning, but the food was just average. I found it a bit overpriced for what you get. The service was decent, but I don't think I'd come back for a meal. Maybe for drinks with friends, but not for a dining experience.

Not worth it
The service was slow, and the food was not very impressive. We were left waiting for a long time, and when our order came, it was not as fresh as expected. I'd say it was a disappointing experience.

Not my taste
I found the experience to be a bit underwhelming. While the service was acceptable, the food didn't quite live up to the hype. I expected something unique, but the flavors were somewhat bland. It's a nice place to hang out with friends, but don't go expecting a mind-blowing meal.

Not for everyone
Unfortunately, my experience wasn't the best. The waiting time was long, and when the food finally arrived, it was lukewarm. Some of the dishes lacked seasoning, which made the whole meal feel a bit flat. It's not the worst place I've been, but there are better options around.

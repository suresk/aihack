Welcome! This hackathon consists of two parts - a set of warmup tasks that you should aim to complete as many of as possible in the first 40 minutes, and a second open-ended section for you to make as much progress as you can.

# Warmup Tasks

It is probably best if you complete the first one before attempting others, but after that you can do them in whatever order. Complete as many as you can!

1. Figure out which Chat applications your team has access to, and decide on one to use together. If you don't have one, sign up for one below:

[**Open AI**](https://chat.openai.com/)
[**Google Gemini**](https://gemini.google.com/)
[**Mistral**](https://auth.mistral.ai/ui/login)

2. Creative

Generate a team name (maybe based on the people on your team, the companies they are from, etc?) and a logo.

3. Information retrieval/organization

Generate summaries of each company in your group. How close are they?

4. Data cleaning

Download [this csv](data.csv) - it is customer data that has some issues. Can you clean it up and make it usable?

5. Content summarization

Download [this text file](reviews.txt) - it has 20 reviews about 2 restuarants. What kind of summarization can you get from it? 

6. Coding (try to let your less-technical members do this one!)

Build a simple calculator with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You can paste the code in [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) to see it run.

# Main Task

Now that you have seen some examples of things you can do and how you interact with an llm, it is time to build something useful (or at least the kernel of something useful). Can you think of an idea around your job and/or company that you could start on? Here are some ideas if you don't have any:

- A customer service chatbot
- A bot that helps you write one-pagers for product ideas that match your company's requirements and style
- Onboarding help for new employees
- What is an annoying part of your job you wish you didn't have to do anymore?
- Still stuck? Try asking the LLM for ideas.
